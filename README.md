## High-Level Overview

This is an attempt to recreate Noita's particle simulation in Java. I'm using a similar approach to former attempts by using cellular automata to manage interactions between particles.

## Program Structure

The Particle class will have [complete later].

## Dependencies

This project is built using Maven, and uses the Light Weight Game Library for Java, in order to access OpenGL bindings.
