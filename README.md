## High-Level Overview

This is an attempt to recreate Noita's particle simulation in Java. I'm using a similar approach to other people's projects attempting the same, by using cellular automata to manage interactions between particles.

## Program Structure

The Particle class will have [complete later].

## Dependencies

The only dependencies of this project are built in java utilities, such as Java AWT.
